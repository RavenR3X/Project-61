        <h1>Gaming and Making YouTube videos</h1>
        <img src="download.jpg">
        <p>I like to play games on electronic devices because they are very fun even if I am not good at them they are still fun to play!. Whenever I am not doing anything beside playing games or making videos on YouTube I am probably just practicing Classical Music or reading a book or watching videos on YouTube. Besides practicing music, watching videos or reading a book, I do things that I find fun to do like, helping mom with her work so that she can get a rest from all the housework or just cleaning my table to stay organized and clean. Making YouTube videos is actually more fun than you might think they are you, just need to like those sort of things. After making some videos you get the hang of it and it's actually pretty fun making the video then editing the bad parts of it to seem good or just cut them from the video. That's basically what I do with the videos I create.</p>

        <h2> Playing Badminton and Football</h2>
        <p>
            Another one of my hobbies is Playing Sports I relly like to play Badminton and Football. I am not good at either of those but I still love playing sports. But playing sports isn't an option now because Now LockDown has started but most people don't really care about going outside without wearing masks. I can actually play sports now but I don't know with whom because nobobdy plays any sports now-a-days. I like playing Badminton and Football because I grew up playing them and they are VERY FUN to play.I also go to coaching classes for Badminton(Well atleast I used to go).

        <p>I absolutely LOVE to play games and making YouTube videos on the games I play. I was inspired by my Older Brother to play games and suddenly I fell in love with playing games, especially FPS (first person shooter) games because they were really very entertaining to play. I also like to play RPGs (Role Playing Game) they are also very fun to play but also very time consuming. I was inpired to make videos on YouTube by a YouTuber called 'DanTDM' he plays lots of games and is very family-friendly. I also make YouTube videos becauuse in hard times like now during the lockdown due to COVID-19, I get bored really quickly, so I decided to make videos for other people to entertain them(Also please subscribe to my channel, Thanks in advance). </p>
